# Great Plains Transport
Welcome to Great Plains Transport, a demonstration website showcasing my skills in frontend and backend development using NEXT.js, React, and Javascript. This website was created for a fictional trucking company, and includes four main pages: Home, About, Contact, and Services.

I have utilized Bootstrap with React to create various components for the website, including the navigation menu, forms, and more. In addition to using pre-existing Bootstrap components, I have also created custom React components to bring the website together.

The Home and About pages provide information about the company, including its mission and values. The Contact page includes a form for users to get in touch with Great Plains Transport.

The Services page is where things get interesting. This page allows users to request a quote for transportation services by inputting their pickup and delivery locations. The page uses an API to calculate the distance between these locations and provide an estimated quote. It also suggests potential pickup and delivery locations based on the user's input.

In addition to its functional features, Great Plains Transport features fancy CSS animations and a modern design that looks great on both mobile and desktop devices. The navigation menu is a circle split into four pie slices that users can click to access the different pages.
